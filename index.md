## Welcome to YourMorning

YourMoring is a setup guide intended for Mac users. In this guide, you'll learn how to 
create a bash command that opens daily webpages accessed (typically) in the morning.

### Background

This guide assumes you have access to a Mac and at least some prior programming
knowledge. The choice of the programming language is yours alone, however, I 
encourage Python; justified primarily by its ease and swiftness (earnestly, no pun intended). 

### Enumerating Your Needs
1. Mac
2. [Python Interpreter] (https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/)
3. [Emacs] (https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html)
4. Access to Terminal

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/acdlee/acdlee.github.io-YourMorning/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
